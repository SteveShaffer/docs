# Rectangle

When facebox detects a face, it returns a rectangle object that looks like this:

```json
"rect": {
  "top": 38,
  "left": 527,
  "width": 75,
  "height": 75
}
```

* `top` - (int) The distance of the face from the top of the image (Y axis)
* `left` - (int) The distance of the face from the left of the image (X axis)
* `width` - (int) How wide the face is (pixels)
* `height` - (int) How high the face is (pixels)

## Rendering the face with CSS

To render the face in CSS, set the original image as the background image of an element like
`<div>`, and apply the following CSS:

```css
element {
  width: {rect.width}px;
  height: {rect.height}px;
  backgroundPosition: -{rect.left}px -{rect.top}px;
}
```

* The `backgroundPosition` is essentially moving the background image such that the top/left of the element aligns with the top/left of the rectangle

In jQuery, it might look like this:

```javascript
$('element').css({
  width: rect.width,
  height: rect.height,
  backgroundPosition: '-'+rect.left+'px -'+rect.top+'px'
})
```

If you want to overlay the face element onto the original image, make both images `position: absolute`
and add a margin to the face element:

```css
element {
  position: absolute;
  width: {rect.width}px;
  height: {rect.height}px;
  backgroundPosition: -{rect.left}px -{rect.top}px;

  marginTop: {rect.top};
  marginLeft: {rect.left};
}
```

In jQuery:

```javascript
$('element').css({
  position: 'absolute',
  width: rect.width,
  height: rect.height,
  backgroundPosition: '-'+rect.left+'px -'+rect.top+'px',

  marginTop: rect.top,
  marginLeft: rect.left
})
```

This allows you to build an experience where each detected face has its own element which can
be distinctly styled like in the example below:

You can see this working for real by accessing the [Live demo](http://localhost:8080/demo) when you have facebox running locally.
