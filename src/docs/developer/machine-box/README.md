## What is Machine Box?

With Machine Box, you can utilize powerful artifical intelligence and machine learning
capabilities without a science degree. We do all that data science and model training
for you, and wrap it up into a Docker image that you can deploy once or a million times,
on-prem, or in the cloud.

* Self-contained: No external calls: Everything runs inside the container—your data stays with you
* Deploy and scale: Deploys everywhere: as many instances as you need
* Predictable pricing: Free for you, simple subscription fees for companies
* Get to Production in minutes: Get a key and try one of our boxes right now—ship your first feature in minutes
* Unlimited: No annoying API limits—it's your box
* Built for developers: Dead simple usage suitable for developers of any level with interactive console built right into the box

## Welcome to docs

We'll try and keep this documentation light and to the point, and it mostly contains tutorials,
articles, hints and tips for how to make the most of the boxes.

## Get started

Without further ado, why don't you spin up an instance of a box now and see it running for yourself.

We've put together a [very simple tutorial](developer/machine-box/boxes/tagbox/recognizing-images) where you will
use tagbox to identify the content of images - yes, it feels like magic and lies, but wait until you see what it can do.

## Meet the boxes
