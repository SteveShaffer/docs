| field | definition |
| ----- | ---------- |
| type | message type (constant string "engine_heartbeat") |
| timestampUTC | UTC timestamp (milliseconds since epoch) when message created |
| engineId | engineId of producer of heartbeat |
| engineInstanceId | instanceId to distinguish multiple instances of same engine (can be AMI + containerId) |
| taskId | taskId engine is working on |
| tdoId | tdoId engine is working on |
| count | the heartbeat count, starting at 1 and incrementing on each heartbeat |
| status | Signal for whether an engine terminates unexpectedly or expectedly.  It helps with cleaning up after engine terminates and also to gather better metrics on system health. </br>Possible values: </br>"RUNNING" - engine is running and will send further heartbeats </br>"DONE" - engine will terminate successfully and this is last heartbeat message </br> "FAILED" - engine will terminate due to failure and this is last heartbeat message |
| upTime | continuous time (in milliseconds) engine instance has been running. |
| bytesRead | cumulative number of bytes read (for engines that read streams) |
| bytesWritten | cumulative number of bytes written (for engines that write streams) |
| messagesWritten | cumulative number of messages published (for engines that write chunks) |
| errorMsg | an optional error message if the heartbeat indicates a failure status |
