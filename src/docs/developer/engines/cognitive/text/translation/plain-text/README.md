# Translating Plain Text Documents

Plain text documents are one of the [five input formats](/developer/engines/cognitive/text/translation/?id=engine-input-options) that translation engines can support.

## Engine Manifest

Plain text translation engines should specify the following parameters in their build manifest:

| Parameter | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| `engineMode` | `"chunk"` |
| `preferredInputFormat` | `"text/plain; charset=utf-8"` |
| `supportedInputFormats` | `["text/plain", "text/plain; charset=utf-8"]` |
| `outputFormats` | `["text/plain", "text/plain; charset=utf-8"]` |

Here is a minimal example `manifest.json` that could apply to a translation engine:

[](manifest.example.json ':include :type=code json')

[](../../../../_snippets/engine-manifest-pointer.md ':include')

## Engine Input

Plain text translation engines should be implemented as [segment processing](/developer/engines/processing-modes/segment-processing/) engines.
Each segment will be the entire contents of one plain text file.

## Engine Output

Because plain text translation generates a file and not merely data, generating plain text translation engine output is slightly more involved than other cognitive engine outputs, requiring the uploading of assets and the referencing of their IDs.

> The official `media-translated` validation contract json-schema is available
[here](/schemas/vtn-standard/media-translated/media-translated.json ':ignore').

The engine should create a separate plain text file for each desired output language.
Once the files are generated, the engine should do the following to properly register the result with aiWARE:

1. Call the [`getSignedWritableUrls` query](/apis/reference/query/?id=getsignedwritableurls) to retrieve pre-authorized URL destinations to which the files can be posted.

    ```graphql
    query {
      getSignedWritableUrls(number: 2) {
        url  # The URL to PUT to
        unsignedUrl  # The URL to submit with createAsset
      }
    }
    ```

1. For each file, upload the file to one of the URLs with an HTTP `PUT` request.
Each file must have a distinct URL.
PUTing to the same URL twice will overwrite the contents of the first PUT request.

1. For each file, call the [`createAsset` mutation](/apis/reference/mutation/?id=createasset) and obtain an asset ID for each.

    ```graphql
    mutation {
      createAsset(input: {
        containerId: "<The TDO ID of this task>"
        type: "media"
        contentType: "text/plain"
        uri: "<the unsignedUrl from the getSignedWritableUrls call>"
        details: {
          language: "en-US"
        }
      }) {
        id
      }
    }
    ```

  ?> You can include multiple mutations in one request if you [alias them](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#aliases)

  ?> Steps 2 and 3 can be combined by simply calling the `createAsset` mutation using `multipart/form-data` to submit the contents of the text file along with creating the asset, rather than referencing the contents by `uri`.

1. Return your `vtn-standard` response in the following format:

[](../../../../../../../schemas/vtn-standard/media-translated/examples/basic.json ':include :type=code json')

[](../_snippets/advanced-combined-doc-translation.md ':include')

[](../../../../../../../schemas/vtn-standard/media-translated/examples/with-text.json ':include :type=code json')
