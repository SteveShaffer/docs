# Getting Started with Engines

If you're looking to extend aiWARE with custom engine processing, you're most likely looking to develop a [cognitive engine](/developer/engines/cognitive/).
While there are technically various other [engine types](/developer/engines/?id=engine-types),
[processing modes](/developer/engines/processing-modes/),
and runtimes,
almost all extension of aiWARE is currently done by building cognitive engines using the [engine toolkit](/developer/engines/toolkit/).

The quickest way to get started building your custom cognitive engine is to do the following:

1. Review the [Technologies Used](/developer/engines/getting-started/technologies/) section if you're unfamiliar with Docker.
1. Follow the instructions in the [Engine Toolkit](/developer/engines/toolkit/) section to setup your local development environment.
1. Find the class and capability in the [Building Cognitive Engines](/developer/engines/cognitive/) guide and click through to documentation specific to your engine's capability.
If you don't see a matching capability, don't worry; reach out to our developer ecosystem team to discuss how best to implement your custom engine.
1. When you're ready to monetize your custom engine, review the [Path to Monetization](/developer/engines/getting-started/path-to-monetization/) guide.
If necessary, reach out to our developer ecosystem team to discuss monetization models.
1. When you're finally ready to submit your engine for distribution, follow the instructions under the [Engine Approval Process](/developer/engines/approval/) to submit your engine to our ecosystem team for review.
