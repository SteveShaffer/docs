In this step, we'll create a Dockerfile, and use Docker to create a deployable engine _build_.

?> This step assumes that you have already installed Docker on your MacOS or Linux development machine. (Docker for Windows is not yet supported.)

## Why Docker?

Veritone engines are Docker containers that run in the aiWARE platform.
Conceptually, you can think of a Docker image as a self-contained, runnable black box that has a single well-defined entry point.

?> Terminology note: A Docker _container_ is a running instance of a Docker _image_. 

Implementing engines as Docker images brings many benefits, including:

* **Easy deployment**: Everything is in one self-contained physical file (called an _image_, or a _build_) that contains its own configuration info.
* **Process isolation**: A Dockerized app runs in its own sandbox, fully insulated from other runtimes.
* **Scalability**: Veritone can dynamically spin up as many or as few instances of your engine as conditions warrant.
* **Network friendliness**: Dockerized apps can communicate with the world (or with each other) via many network topologies.
* **CI/CD-friendliness**: Docker is command-line-driven and offers a good fit with build-automation technology.
* And lots more.

> If you're new to Docker, you might want to spend some time with the [Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

## Be Sure Your Project Is Structured Correctly

Take a moment to be sure your project files are in the correct places, so that Docker can find them.
As mentioned in [the first page of this tutorial](developer/engines/tutorial/), the project files should look like:

<pre>/hello-world
    |&mdash; /dist
        |&mdash; engine
    |&mdash; Dockerfile
    |&mdash; index.js
    |&mdash; keyword-extraction.js
    |&mdash; manifest.json
    |&mdash; package.json
    |&mdash; /var
</pre>

?> One reason this is important is tha your Dockerfile instructions will tell Docker how to copy your `manifest.json` file into the build. Without this manifest, your engine will not deploy correctly later on.

## Create Your Dockerfile

A [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) is just a text file that explains to Docker how to build an image. You can think of a it as a recipe made up of one-line commands (although if you want, commands _can_ span more than one line).

The syntax for Dockerfiles is actually pretty self-explanatory. If you read a Dockerfile, it's usually clear what's going on.

Here's the Dockerfile for our Hello World project:

```dockerfile 
FROM mhart/alpine-node:8
COPY . /app
COPY manifest.json /var/

COPY ./dist/engine /app/engine

WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install -i

RUN apk update \
        && apk upgrade \
        && apk --no-cache add ca-certificates

ENV VERITONE_WEBHOOK_READY="http://0.0.0.0:8080/readyz"
ENV VERITONE_WEBHOOK_PROCESS="http://0.0.0.0:8080/process"

RUN chmod +x /app/engine

ENTRYPOINT [ "/app/engine", "node", "index.js" ]
```

### Line by Line:

Your Dockerfile should contain exactly one FROM command, at the very top. The purpose of this command is to specify the _base image_ from which your custom Docker image will be built.

?> In the Docker world, every Docker image must be built off a parent (base) image.

Our Dockerfile says to base our image off `mhart/alpine-node:8`, which is a minimal Node.js image, on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/), available via [https://hub.docker.com/r/mhart/alpine-node](https://hub.docker.com/r/mhart/alpine-node).

 `COPY . /app` means to copy (recursively) everything in the current context &mdash; that is, the current directory &mdash; to a folder called `/app`.

 `COPY manifest.json /var/` means to copy our manifest file to the `/var/` folder.
 
 `RUN npm install -i` means to run the Node package manager, npm, using the `install` command. By default, `npm install` will install all modules listed as dependencies in `package.json`, if such a file exists.
 
 `COPY ./dist/engine /app/engine` means what you think it does: Copy our `engine` file from `/dist` to `/app/engine`.
 
 `WORKDIR /app` means to make `/app` our working directory.
 
 `RUN apk update \
      && apk upgrade \
      && apk --no-cache add ca-certificates` &mdash; This updates Alpine Linux to include the latest CA-certs so that TLS works properly.
  
 > If you fail to update your image's certificates, your engine may report X.509-related ("untrusted site") errors at runtime when you attempt to access signed URIs.
          
`ENV VERITONE_WEBHOOK_READY="http://0.0.0.0:8080/readyz"` &mdash; Sets the environment variable that tells the `engine` driver which route to contact with the readiness probe.

`ENV VERITONE_WEBHOOK_PROCESS="http://0.0.0.0:8080/process"` &mdash; Env variable to identify the "process" route.

`RUN chmod +x /app/engine` &mdash; Make sure the `engine` file is executable.

### Entry Point

The final line of our Dockerfile, `ENTRYPOINT [ "/app/engine", "node", "index.js" ]`, tells Docker where to find the entry point of our container.
On startup, we want our container to execute the `engine` binary, which is the Toolkit driver.
The driver will (in turn) pick up extra command-line arguments that tell it how to fire up our engine. (Namely: Run `node` with an argument of `index.js`.)

## Building the Engine

To build your engine, run the following command in a terminal (e.g., a bash shell):

```bash
docker build -t hello-world .
```

> Do not omit the trailing period in this command.

The Docker daemon should swing into action,  building your image.  In the console, you'll see something similar to this:

The console messages, as you can see, are reasonably verbose (and, for the most part, self-explanatory). If your build encounters errors, you'll be told exactly which Dockerfile command failed, and why.

In this case, our build went smoothly. Which means we're ready to test the engine!

## Recap and Cheat Sheet

In this lesson, we learned how to: 
* Create Docker build instructions in a simple text file called a _Dockerfile_.
* Base a build off a preexisting parent build or _base image_ using the `FROM` keyword.
* Use `COPY` to make Docker copy files.
* Use `RUN` to make Docker execute shell instructions during the build process.
* Use `RUN` commands to update an image's CA certificates so that container-based SSL works at runtime.
* Use `ENV` to specify container-specific environment variables.
* Use `ENTRYPOINT` to specify the runtime entry point of our Docker container.
* Use the `docker build` command to create an engine's _build_ (the deployable image).
