# Overview

Whether you are starting out on Automate Studio or trying to deepen your already existing skills, these training courses are intended to help you accomplish your upskill goals.

## Who This Curriculum is For

This curriculum is intended for anybody trying to learn how they can use Automate Studio to incorporate AI into a solution to solve a business problem!

If you are considering these training courses, ideally you have worked as a business analyst, as a system analyst, or have some hobby experience hacking on your own weekend projects. However, we want to emphasize none of that is required.

### Helpful Knowledge

While we understand some folks may have a much more advanced background, we will approach this exercise assuming you know very little on technical subjects. If you have a technical background you are of course welcome to scan and make your own decisions.

That being said, we find familiarity with these subjects is helpful, especially for more advanced courses:

1. High level understanding of the concept of an API
1. Business process diagramming
1. System configuration (including systems like Salesforce.com, Pipedrive, Zendesk)
1. Database queries for retrieving and updating information

## What we'll cover

These training courses are intended to take you from an Automate Studio (and aiWARE) beginner to an advanced user of our services, and potentially even leveling up your technical understanding as well!

Again, we understand that you may not be trying to immediately level up, our goal is to give you tools that you can use without
