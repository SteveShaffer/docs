# Overview

Whether you are starting out on Automate Studio or trying to deepen your already existing skills, these training courses are intended to help you accomplish your upskill goals.

## Who This Curriculum is For

This curriculum is intended for anybody trying to learn how they can use Automate Studio to incorporate AI into a solution to solve a business problem!

If you are considering these training courses, ideally you have worked as a business analyst, as a system analyst, or have some hobby experience hacking on your own weekend projects. However, we want to emphasize none of that is required.

### Helpful Knowledge

While we understand some folks may have a much more advanced background, we will approach this exercise assuming you know very little on technical subjects. If you have a technical background you are of course welcome to scan and make your own decisions.

That being said, we find familiarity with these subjects is helpful, especially for more advanced courses:

1. High level understanding of the concept of an API
1. Business process diagramming
1. System configuration (including systems like Salesforce.com, Pipedrive, Zendesk)
1. Database queries for retrieving and updating information

## What we'll cover

These training courses are intended to take you from an Automate Studio (and aiWARE) beginner to an advanced user of our services, and potentially even leveling up your technical understanding as well!

Again, we understand that you may not be trying to immediately level up, our goal is to give you tools that you can use without feeling like you have to invest in learning a whole new professional track. As with most things, we have found that individuals who are most willing to learn new things will get the absolute most out of both this training course and Automate Studio.

We consider each of these sections to be modules that contain their own exercises to help you practice your understanding of and abilities with Automate Studio.

1. Business and Value Proposition - this module serves as the introduction to Automate Studio for folks focused on understanding how Automate Studio and aiWARE can help their companies become more efficient, more effective at customer service, and more profitable.
1. Crawl - the Crawl module is a methodical introduction to Automate Studio by walking you through simple practical examples of how you could get started with Automate Studio and start introducing AI into your business processes.
1. Walk - this intermediate module is for ramping on concepts that were either lightly touched on in Crawl, or new concepts that we need to introduce to push your understanding of what is possible with Automate Studio
1. Run - this is our advanced module of the initial training program. In it, we dig in deeper to topics previously discussed and introduce more technical aspects of what can be done with the tool. However, we do provide examples and logic snippets you can copy from both for this training and for your own future Automate Studio solutions.
