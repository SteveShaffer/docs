# Automate Studio Value Proposition

This module is focused on introducing the value propositions of key concepts of both Automate Studio and the broader aiWARE platform that Automate Studio will enable you to quickly deploy your own AI powered solutions on.

## The aiWARE Technology Stack

The key point of aiWARE for you to know is that the aiWARE platform was built with the ability to process _all_ kinds of data, especially audio and visual data, not just the structured data that makes up only a small portion of the broader web.

To do this effectively, we had to break up each piece of the puzzle of what it meant to process audiovisual content with AI processing and how we could make each component modular and most importantly, accessible for a third party user to be able to use for their own solutions.

We think of each of these puzzle pieces as a "layer" of our aiWARE technology stack, with each layer stacked on top of the other.

Starting from the bottom of the stack:

1. Data Ingestion Layer
1. Cognition Layer
1. Orchestration Layer
1. Metadata Search & Indexin Layer
1. Integration Layer
1. Application Layer

## Deploying AI Where You Need It

The aiWARE platform was architected to be flexibly deployed in whatever kind of environment you might need for your own requirements. This means that while although Veritone offers a managed cloud service of aiWARE, as a user, you can deploy and run aiWARE on your own environments, whether a local macbook, a third party cloud provider, or even a raspberry pi!

There are two components that make up aiWARE:

1. aiWARE Core - this is where users can search for indexed metadata produced by the various cognitive processes users have run or are still running
1. aiWARE Edge - this is where AI/ML models and other custom logic (including Automate Studio flow engines) are run data streams ingested from various sources, including radio and TV streams, S3 bucket, or cloud filesystems.

## Applications

The Application layer holistically includes GUI applications like our "Essentials" package of apps like CMS and Discovery, as well as the underlying GraphQL APIs that each application is built on. You also have access to the exact same API with which to build your own applications.

Our Essentials package of apps includes:

1. CMS
1. Discovery
1. Collections
1. Library

You can use our Developer app as the hub for accessing our "builder suite" of tools for building your own apps and integrations, either with standalone code, or our low-code application, Automate Studio.

## Automate Studio for Developers

We think about Automate Studio as the all-in-one solutoin for designing, building, and managing AI powered apps that help you quickly deploy AI solutions into your larger processes or organization.

Fundamentally, Automate Studio enables you to enrich your other applications by connecting to them, processing the relevent data, and then sending the results back into that application. Because of Automate's flexibility and drag and drop UI, the time to get started with AI is accelerated from weeks and months, to mere days.
