## CMS

**Veritone CMS** (Content Management System) is used to ingest/add media, delete media, define cognitive workflows, process new or previously processed media with additional artificial intelligence engines, organize ingested media, check the status of engine execution, and view summary statistics for all ingested media.

## Discovery

**Veritone Discovery** allows users to create and execute direct searches against cognitive engine output, either through predefined programmatic queries (called watchlists) or by ad-hoc searches.
Permission-controlled actions including downloading media clips, editing cognitive metadata, and sharing search results are also enabled within the application.

## Collections

**Veritone Collections** presents groupings of search results or watchlists in shareable units called collections.
Users and organizations can extend and amplify their media by customizing and sharing collections and clips via embedded widgets, social media, or email.

## Library

**Veritone Library** provides capabilities for creating custom databases of entities (like people, places, or things) that can be used for training recognition engines.
Veritone Library also includes a set of pre-defined libraries with more than 10,000 famous faces from around the world, including athletes, TV/news personalities, celebrities, and foreign dignitaries.

## IDentify

**Veritone IDentify** is a purpose-built solution for law enforcement agencies to quickly analyze their photo and video evidence against their databases of known offenders and suspects.

## Redact

**Veritone Redact** is a purpose-built solution for law enforcement agencies, law firms, or anyone else who needs to quickly redact faces, license plates, audio, or any other items from digital evidence.
It uses AI engines to automatically follow faces and other user-tagged objects throughout a video and blur them, greatly reducing the time needed to redact sensitive materials.

## Attribute

**Veritone Attribute** is a purpose-built solution for broadcasters to track efficacy of their advertising by correlating live reads, pre-recorded spots, or any other types of advertisements against signals like web traffic and social interactions.
Attribute uses AI engines to transcribe audio and correlate structured data to zero in on advertisements in recorded broadcasts.
Then it automatically correlates those advertisements against online analytics or other signals of engagement and presents the results with beautifully simple visualizations and data reports.

## Commerce

**Veritone Commerce** (formerly from Wazee Digital) is a purpose-built solution for rights holders that lets you grow your revenue by helping buyers uncover relevant content they can use to make award-winning projects.
Commerce is supported by an experienced research and advisory team that works with creatives to find the right content and assist with any additional rights and clearances should they be required.

## Core

**Veritone Core** (formerly from Wazee Digital) is a cloud-native digital asset management (DAM) system used to manage, share and monetize content.
Capable of ingesting large amounts of assets across a broad range of audio, video and still image formats, Core leverages the power of aiWARE to automatically enrich the metadata of every asset it ingests.

## Digital Media Hub

**Digital Media Hub** (formerly from Wazee Digital) is an intuitive web portal through which you can offer secure, cloud-native global access to your content to key stakeholders, including news media and corporate partners.
And the best part? You can customize the look and feel of your portal to properly represent your brand.

## Admin

**Veritone Admin** is used to establish, monitor, and manage account configurations, such as user permissions and cognitive workflows.

[Veritone Developer](/developer/) is a self-service environment where registered developers can access tools,
documentation, APIs to build and submit their AI applications, adapters, cognitive engines or data schemas to extend aiWARE for their own use, or submit their extensions for distributing to other users.
We are constantly adding new features to Veritone Developer, increasing the power and flexibility available at developers' fingertips.
