# Training Library-Enabled Engines

The Veritone platform automatically triggers training jobs for
all compatible engines whenever a given library is published.
For example, when a user publishes a library containing people,
the platform launches training jobs for all facial recognition engines.

During development it may be helpful to manually trigger training
jobs against existing, unchanged libraries.
You can do so with the following query. Substitute your own
engine, library, and library engine model IDs.

```graphql
mutation {
  createJob(input: {
    tasks: [
      {
        engineId: "9f60a772-e8dd-480b-918e-5779d8eb02f0"
        payload: {
          mode: "library-train"
          libraryId: "5943cafd-7eea-4913-9496-2afdea89f08b"
          libraryEngineModelId: "88540e51-6418-4b05-9349-4b2f4c230eb1"
        }
      }
    ]
  }) {
    id
    tasks {
      records {
        id
        status
        payload
        engine {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Training mode will typically follow the following workflow:

## Step 1: Update the model's `trainStatus` field to `running`

```graphql
mutation {
  updateLibraryEngineModel(input: {
    id: "4ae6d34d-8f4a-4e4e-aefa-12964cbf29c9",
    trainStatus: running
  }) {
    id
    trainStatus
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Get the library, its entities, and its identifiers

`identifierTypeId` should be set to the appropriate value (for example, "face" if your engine requires faces, or "audio-recording" if it requires audio). Use `limit` and `offset` to page through returned values as necessary. Both entities and identifiers can contain metadata in a field called `jsondata`, which can optionally be used by your engine.

```graphql
query GetIdentifiers($identifierTypeId: ID, $offset: Int = 0, $limit: Int = 25) {
  library(id: "17a86304-9a82-4943-a06e-a2eb1c2506cc") {
    id
    name
    entities(identifierTypeId: $identifierTypeId, offset: $offset, limit: $limit) {
      count
      records{
        id
        name
        jsondata
        identifiers(identifierTypeId: $identifierTypeId, limit: $limit) {
          count
          records {
            id
            url
            jsondata
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When training large libraries (100s or 1000s of entities), it is
strongly advisable to implement code that performs well and avoids
exceeding usage limits.

* Use paging with a moderate page size, such as the default of `30`
* Limit the number of entities and identifiers that are processed
concurrently. In synchronous code, this is typically automatic in a
simple loop-based implementation, but in asynchronous code such as
JavaScript it may be necessary to use protective measures such as `async.limit()`.

## Step 3: Train your engine using the returned identifiers and metadata

This step is largely engine-dependent, but the idea here is be able to map a trained item back to a specific entity or identifier in the library. This is typically done by using either the entity ID or entity identifier ID, so that when the engine recognizes/detects that item on later executions, it will return an ID that can easily be mapped to library resources. Sometimes this is not possible and the engine will generate its own identifiers. In such cases, simply generate a mapping from the engine's IDs to the library entity ID/entity identifier IDs, and save it in some format, such as JSON. This mapping can then be saved with the engine model and referenced when necessary.

## Step 4: Update the `trainStatus` and save model data

If training failed for any reason, update the `trainStatus` to `failed`:

```graphql
mutation {
  updateLibraryEngineModel(input: {
    id: "4ae6d34d-8f4a-4e4e-aefa-12964cbf29c9",
    trainStatus: failed
    jsondata: {
      error: "something failed"
    }
  }) {
    id
    trainStatus
    jsondata
  }
}
```

If training completed successfully update the `trainStatus` to `complete`. In the case of web API-based engines, the trained model is referenced by some sort of ID that is used to refer to that model in future invocations. In this step, you would save that (as well as any other information) to the libraryEngineModel metadata container, called `jsondata`. For example, let's say this API uses a parameter called `collectionId`. Your update query would look something like the following:

```graphql
mutation {
  updateLibraryEngineModel(input: {
    id: "4ae6d34d-8f4a-4e4e-aefa-12964cbf29c9",
    trainStatus: complete
    jsondata: {
      collectionId: "abcd-1234-efgh-5678",
      fingerprints: 3
    }
  }) {
    id
    trainStatus
    jsondata
    modifiedDateTime
  }
}
```

In some cases, such as for many containerized engines, a resulting data file or representation of the engine state is generated by the engine. Another case would include the custom mapping data mentioned in Step 3. The idea here is to export that data and save it to the libraryEngineModel record. To do so, use a `multipart/form-data` request. The `Content-Type` header is required for the file part and should specify the mime-type of the provided data file. You'll notice, then once saved, `Content-Type` will be included as a field called `contentType` in the model metadata.
