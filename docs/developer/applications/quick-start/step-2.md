# Step 2. Set Up User and API Authentication Using OAuth 2.0

Once your app is registered, the next step is to implement an authentication mechanism for your app to connect to Veritone user accounts. Integrated apps in Veritone use the [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/) protocol to authenticate, provide single sign-on, and generate tokens for use with APIs. It works by delegating user authentication to Veritone and then authorizing your application to obtain specific user account data while keeping usernames, passwords, and other information private.

## General OAuth Flow

The general authentication flow consists of a three-part process that starts with the user authenticating with their Veritone credentials, then authorizing your app to access the Veritone system, and finally allowing your app to access the user’s data.

![general-flow](VDA-AppQS-Step2-OAuth-General-Flow.png)

1. A "Sign in with Veritone" button on your app’s login page initiates user authentication. When a user clicks the button, it redirects them to Veritone’s OAuth 2 server to log in, which authenticates their identity and authorizes your application to access their account. Once the user logs in, an authorization code is sent to your app.

2. Your application requests an _Access Token_ from Veritone’s authorization server by presenting the authorization code along with credentials to verify its identity. If your application's identity is authenticated and the authorization code is valid, an _Access Token_ is issued to your application and authorization is complete.

3. Your application uses the _Access Token_ to request user account resources from the Veritone API (resource server). If the _Access Token_ is valid, the resource server returns the requested resource to your application.

Depending on the specific flow type that you use, the actual process will differ slightly from the general flow shown above. Veritone supports two flows for authentication:

* The **Authorization Code Flow** is designed for server-side apps that are capable of securely storing the client secret.

* The **Implicit Flow** is designed for apps that have no back-end logic on the web server (e.g., a Javascript app).

Detailed information about the different flows is provided later in this document to help you decide which one is best suited for your application. If you already know which flow you want to use, you can jump directly to the Authorization Code Flow or Implicit Flow section.

## Getting Started

Before using OAuth with your application, you must register your application with the Veritone. All registered Veritone-integrated applications are issued a set of authorization credentials that identify the app to Veritone’s OAuth 2.0 server. Once your application is registered, Veritone will issue a _Client ID_ and a _Client Secret_.

* **Application Client ID:** A publicly exposed string that is used by the Veritone API to identify your application. The *Client ID* is also built into the Authorization URL that authenticates users .

* **Client Secret:** A unique value used to authenticate the identity of your application to the Veritone API when your application requests to access a user's account. The *Client Secret* must be kept private.

* **Redirect URI:** The URI where the user will be directed after they authorize your application to access your account. The *Redirect URI* must point to the part of your application that will handle authorization codes or access tokens.

### Access the Client ID, Client Secret & Redirect URI

The app's _Client ID_ (a), _OAuth Redirect URI_ (b), and _Client Secret_ (c) can be viewed on the *Application* settings page.
(The Client Secret can be seen once you click the _click to reveal_ link.)
![client-secret1](VDA-URLs.png)

To get to this view, log in to Veritone Developer and click **Applications** on the menu sidebar, then choose your application from the Applications Dashboard.

### Examples and Libraries

The [passport-veritone](https://github.com/veritone/veritone-sdk/tree/master/packages/passport-veritone) library provides a strategy for [Passport JS](http://www.passportjs.org/) which can be used in NodeJS apps to handle the OAuth2 token exchange.

[veritone-widgets-server](https://github.com/veritone/veritone-sdk/tree/master/packages/veritone-widgets-server) implements the full token exchange using passport-veritone.

[veritone-oauth-helpers](https://github.com/veritone/veritone-sdk/tree/master/packages/veritone-oauth-helpers) implements the client-side portion of the OAuth2 flow, with simple `login()` and `logout()` functions.

## Implementing the Authorization Code Flow

The Authorization Code Flow is designed for server-side applications where source code is not publicly exposed and the confidentiality of the _Client Secret_ can be maintained.
This is a redirection-based flow that begins with user authentication returning an _Authorization Code_ that’s exchanged for an _Access Token_ to access the user’s account.
Along with the _Access Token_, you get a _Refresh Token_ that can be saved in your database and used at a later point to generate a new *Access Token* when the original expires.
Because the Authorization Code Flow uses a *Client ID* and *Client Secret* to retrieve the tokens from the back end, it has the benefit of not exposing tokens to the web browser.

At a high level, the Authorization Code Flow follows these steps when a user attempts to initiate a session with your application by clicking a "Sign In with Veritone" button.</br>

![sign-in-button](VDA-AppQS-Step2-OAuth-Sign-in-with-Veritone-Button.png)

1. Your application redirects the user to the Veritone authorization server, where the user authenticates his or her identity and authorizes your app to access the user's account by logging in.
2. An *Authorization Code* is passed to your application from the Veritone authorization server.
3. Your application sends the *Authorization Code* to Veritone, and Veritone returns an *Access Token* and a *Refresh Token*.
4. Your application can then use the *Access Token* to call the Veritone API and access the user’s account.

![authorization-code-flow](VDA-AppQS-Step2-OAuth-Authorization-Code-Flow.png)

### **Step 1: Authenticate User and Get Authorization Code**

A "Sign In With Veritone" button initiates user authentication.
When a user clicks the button, you'll send the user to an authorization page where he or she will authenticate and give your application permission to access their account.
In this first step, you'll construct a link to the authorization page by adding specific parameters to the query that can identify your app.
The _Client ID_ and *Redirect URI* that you'll need to include in the authorization URL can be found in the settings for your app, which you can get to by clicking the name of your app from the *Applications Dashboard*.
(See earlier screen shot and discussion, above.)

#### Authorization URL Components

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Parameter</b></td>
    <td><b>Type</b></td>
    <td><b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>response_type</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>The type of response being requested. Set the value as "code" to indicate that your application is requesting an authorization code in the response. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>client_id</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>The unique ID of your application. You can get the ID from the Application Settings page.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>redirect_uri</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>The URL that you want the user redirected to after granting access to your app. This must match the Redirect URI value in the Application Settings. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>scope</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>The level of access that your application is requesting. Currently the only permissible value for the scope parameter is "all."</td>
  </tr>
</table>

##### Sample Authorization URL

```http
https://api.veritone.com/v1/admin/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=e6ac4220-5898-456b-b6ae-ff4f4bb6b9bf&redirect_uri=https://bestappever.com/oauth/callback&scope=all
```

#### User Authorizes Application

After clicking the link,the user will be prompted to log into Veritone to authenticate his or her identity and authorize your application to access the user's account.

#### Application Receives Authorization Code

After the user grants access by logging in, the user will arrive at your application’s *Redirect URI* with an _Authorization Code_ query parameter appended to the URL (as shown below).
You'll use that code in the next step to get an _Access Token_ and a _Refresh Token_ from Veritone. If the login was unsuccessful, an error response will be returned in place of the *Authorization Code*.

##### Sample Redirect URI with Authorization Code

  </tr>
</table>

### **Step 2: Request Access and Refresh Tokens**

Your application uses the _Authorization Code_ it received to request an _Access Token_ and a _Refresh Token_ from the Veritone server. To exchange the code for tokens, make a call to the _Token Exchange_ endpoint with the parameters below posted as a part of the URL-encoded form values.

_Important note:_ To ensure the security of the _Client Secret_, this request must happen from your application server and not the front end of your app.

#### Request Details

```

Your application is now authorized! Use the _Access Token_ to authenticate API requests that your app makes to access the user's account.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>unsupported_grant_type</td>
    <td>The grant_type isn’t authorization_code.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### **Step 3. Using OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens**

Your application will use the *Access Token* to access the user's account via the Veritone API. An *Access Token* is passed as a bearer token in the *Authorization* header of requests.

#### Sample header format

```http
Authorization: Bearer {access token}
```

Access tokens expire after seven days and the *Refresh Token* may be used to request new a new *Access Token* if the initial token expires. If the *Access Token* is expired or otherwise invalid, the API will return an error.

### **Step 4. Using a Refresh Token**

_Access Tokens_ expire every seven days. When an *Access Token* expires, using it to make an API request will result in an "Invalid Token Error." You can use the _Refresh Token_ that was included when the original _Access Token_ was issued to get a new _Access Token_ without requiring the user to be redirected.

#### Request Details

* **HTTP Method:** POST
* **Content Type:** application/x-www-form-urlencoded
* **Response Format:** JSON

  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

## Implementing the Implicit Flow

The Implicit Flow is used for browser-based web applications (without a back-end server) where the confidentiality of the _Client Secret_ cannot be maintained. This is a redirection-based flow with all communication happening on the front end. The token to access a user’s account is given to the browser to forward to the application.

At a high-level, the Implicit Flow follows these steps when a user attempts to initiate a session with your application by clicking a "Sign In with Veritone" button.</br>
![sign-in-button](VDA-AppQS-Step2-OAuth-Sign-in-with-Veritone-Button.png)

1. Your application redirects the user to the Veritone authorization page, where the user authenticates by logging in.
2. Upon user login, Veritone redirects the user back to your application’s *Redirect URI* with an *Access Token* as a URL fragment after the hash.
3. Your application extracts the *Access Token* from the URL and uses it to call the Veritone API and access the user’s account.

![implicit-flow](VDA-AppQS-Step2-OAuth-Implicit-Flow.png)

_Additional notes:_

* The *Client Secret* is not used with the Implicit Flow since it is not able to be kept confidential.
* The Implicit Flow does not support *Refresh Tokens*. As a result, the user must log in again each time they visit your app (if the token is not stored) or when the *Access Token* expires.

### **Step 1: Authenticate User and Get Access Token**

When a user attempts to begin a session with your app, they’ll click a "Sign In With Veritone" button on your login page and initiate the authentication process. In this first step, you'll construct an link that sends the user to Veritone’s authorization page and requests an _Access Token_ from the API.

Use the components shown below to build the authorization URL. The _Client ID_ and _Redirect URI_ that you'll need to include can be found in the settings for your app, which you can get to by clicking the name of your app from the *Applications Dashboard*.

#### Authorization Link Components

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Parameter</b></td>
    <td><b>Type</b></td>
    <td><b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>response_type</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>The type of response being requested. Set the value as "token" to indicate that your application is requesting an Access Token in the response. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>client_id</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>The unique ID of your application. You can get the ID from the Application settings page.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>redirect_uri</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>The URL that you want the user redirected to after granting access to your app. This must match the Redirect URI value in the Application settings. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>scope</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>The level of access that your application is requesting. Currently the only permissible value for the scope parameter is "all."</td>
  </tr>
</table>

##### Sample Authorization URL

```http
https://api.veritone.com/v1/admin/oauth/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=e6ac4220-5898-456b-b6ae-ff4f4bb6b9bf&redirect_uri=https://bestappever.com/oauth/callback&scope=all
```

#### User Authorizes Application

When the user follows the authorization URL, they’re prompted to log in to Veritone to authenticate their identity and authorize your application to access their account.

#### Application Receives Access Token

After the user grants access by logging in, they are sent to your application *Redirect URI* with an _Access Token_ appended to the URL.

##### Sample Redirect URI with Access Token

```

#### Possible Errors

If authorization fails, an error response will be sent to your application redirect URI in the format shown below.

```http
http://yourapp.com#error=<error_ID>
```

Any errors are appended to the URI using one of the following Error IDs.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Error ID</b></td>
    <td><b>Details</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>invalid_request</td>
    <td>The request is missing a necessary parameter or the parameter has an invalid value.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>unauthorized_client</td>
    <td>The Client ID is invalid or the client is not authorized to request an authorization code using this method.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>access_denied</td>
    <td>The server denied the request.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>unsupported_response_type</td>
    <td>The specified response type is invalid or unsupported.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> invalid_scope</td>
    <td>The requested scope is invalid, unknown, or malformed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>server_error</td>
    <td>The server encountered an internal error.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>temporarily_unavailable</td>
    <td>The server is temporarily unavailable but should be able to process the request at a later time</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### **Step 2: Use the Access Token**

Once your application has an _Access Token_, you can use it to access the user's account via the Veritone API. To make requests, pass the _Access Token_ in the _Authorization_ header with the value _Bearer {access token}_.

Access tokens expire after seven days. Unlike the Authorization Code Flow, _Refresh Tokens_ are not issued with the Implicit Flow. Refreshing a token requires use of the Client Secret, which cannot safely be stored with the Implicit Flow. If your application does not store the _Access Token_, users will be required to log in each time they use your app. If your application stores the token, you can use it to perform API calls immediately without requiring any additional action from the user. API calls made with an expired or invalid token will result in an error.
