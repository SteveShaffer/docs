# Step 5 - Submit Your Build for Approval

After your build has passed the compliance testing and is in the *Available* state, the next step is to submit it to Veritone for review by one of our team members. The review process may take up to a business day to complete. Once reviewed, the build status will change to *Approved* or *Disapproved*. If your build is *Approved*, it's eligible to participate in the Veritone ecosystem and can be [deployed](/developer/engines/quick-start/step-6-deploy-engine) at any time. If your build was *Disapproved*, it cannot be deployed to production. Please contact our [developer support team](mailto:devsupport@veritone.com) for more information.
