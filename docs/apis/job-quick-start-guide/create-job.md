# Create a Job with Cognitive Processing Tasks

A Job is a unit of work in aiWARE. The job, in turn, consists of one or more *tasks*.
So for example, you can set up a job to operate against an asset so as to detect objects, 
transcribe the asset’s audio into text, 
and translate between languages. All of that would fit into a "job."

A call to the `createJob` mutation creates a new job with a list of cognitive processing tasks 
based on the engine IDs specified in the request body. 
Additional task payload parameters (that specify how the service is to be performed) are 
required for certain engines. 
If an asset needs to be converted to a supported format for processing, 
the job request must set *transcoding* as the primary task, to convert the file to a 
supported format for processing. 
The *insert into index* parameter is also required to ensure output data 
will be indexed and made searchable in Veritone.

*Important Note about Translation:*

Because translation engines use text to translate one language to another, 
a media file must first be processed for *transcription* before it can be translated. 
Transcription can occur separately, or in the same job with translation.

      engineId: "fc004413-89f0-132a-60b2-b94522fb7e66" => The task engine ID that transcodes the file into a supported format for processing. Video files are transcoded to MP4 and audio files to MP3. Use the exact value shown. (required)
        payload: {           => The payload object for transcoding. (required)
          setAsPrimary: true => A Boolean set to true to ensure the file is transcoded prior to running any other task in the job. (required)
        },

    status        => The status of the job as a whole. Possible Values are “accepted” (the job is valid and has been accepted for processing), “running” (the job is running), “failed” (at least one task failed and job execution was terminated), and “complete” (all tasks in the job finished normally). (required)
    tasks {       => The tasks object parameter with data specific to the job’s tasks. (required)
      records {   => The records object parameter with data specific to individual tasks. (required)
        id        => The unique ID of a task, provided by the server. (required)
